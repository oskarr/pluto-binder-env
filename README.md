# Pluto Binder Environment
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/oskarr/pluto-binder-env/master?urlpath=pluto)

## Why?
This is a fork of [fonsp/pluto-on-binder](https://github.com/fonsp/pluto-on-binder). It's said on that repo that forking it is not optimal, but as of now, I needed a catch-all run-on-Binder environment with pluto as well as a bunch of packages.

### Packages
These packages are included (see [Project.toml](Project.toml)):
* Calculus (incl. QuadGK)
* DataFrames
* Distributions
* FFTW
* FileIO (incl. CSVFiles)
* Images
* LinearAlgebra (and RowEchelon)
* Plots (incl. GR, Plotly, PlotlyBase, StatsPlots)
* Unitful
